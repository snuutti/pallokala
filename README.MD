# Pallokala

![](assets/images/banner.png)

Pallokala is a mobile client for [PufferPanel](https://www.pufferpanel.com) made with React Native. 
The UI attempts to closely mimic the PufferPanel web interface, down to the colors and icons.

> [!NOTE]  
> Pallokala is still in development. Not all features are implemented yet and there may be bugs.

The code is messy in some places. I'm doing this as a hobby for fun, and writing clean code is not fun. I'll clean it up later™️.

## Features

- Multi-server support
  - Email and OAuth 
- AMOLED dark mode

## Missing features

- Template management
- Themes (Ability to modify the stylesheets, won't be added anytime soon if ever)
- I'm sure there are some other small features that I've missed (Let me know!)

Yes, that's really it. Everything else is implemented.
